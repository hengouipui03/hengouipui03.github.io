## GenAI tool used
I used **ChatGPT** to help me complete this assessment.

## How it helped me
ChatGPT helped me mainly with:
- fixing Quarto formatting issues (YAML and headings)
- setting up GitHub Pages correctly (rendering output to `docs/`)
- writing simple content for my website pages

For example, it helped me understand why my `.qmd` pages were not rendering properly and how to format them correctly.

## Benefits
- Saves time when I get stuck
- Gives clear explanations and examples
- Helps with writing and structuring content

## Challenges
- I still need to check and test the output myself
- Sometimes the suggestions only work after adjusting them to my own project

## What I learned
I learned that GenAI is useful as a guide, but I should still understand the steps instead of copying blindly.

> Overall, GenAI made building my website faster and less stressful.
