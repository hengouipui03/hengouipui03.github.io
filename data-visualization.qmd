## My visualization

During my student life, I tracked the number of hours I studied in a week.  
The graph below visualises my study hours from Monday to Sunday.

### What was visualised
- **X-axis:** Day of the week
- **Y-axis:** Study hours (in hours)

### Story behind this task
I created this chart because I wanted to understand my study habits.  
It helped me see which days I studied the most and which days I studied the least.  
From the results, I realised I studied much less on weekends, so I adjusted my schedule.

### Why I chose this visualization
I used a **bar chart** because it is easy to compare numerical values across categories (days of the week).
